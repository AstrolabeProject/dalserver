        This servlet provides both a null/test SLAP to test and illustrate
	the SLAP protocol without requiring any data connection, as well as
	a JDBC-based SLAP which can provide a real SLAP service if it is
	configured properly and provided with some SLAP metadata and an
	associated image database.
