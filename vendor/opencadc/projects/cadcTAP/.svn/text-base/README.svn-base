** OpenCADC Table Access protocol (TAP) library

This is the current cadcTAP library with code to help implement a Table Access Protocol (TAP)
web service. The module is currently (May-June 2014) undergoing refactoring, with some features being 
removed in order to use common code in cadCDALI instead. The changes are source-incompatible with 
previously ~stable code and will continue to change for awhile to come.

If you want stable code like before May 2014, look at the cadcTAP-0.8 directory (fork).

This library works with the cadcUWS library to provide async and sync ADQL query execution on a
RDBMS. See the cadcSampleTAP project for an example of using this library.
